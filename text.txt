    I love to go for long walks in the park.
    Could you please pass me the salt?
    My fav color is blue.
    She is studying medicine at the university.
    The movie starts at 7 am, so we should leave soon.
    It is raining outside, so do not forget your umbrella.
    Can you believe we won the championship?
    I have a meeting at 9 am in the morning.
    Please make sure to turn off the lights before leaving.
    I am sorry, but I cannot make it to the party tonight.
